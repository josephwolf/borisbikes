WELCOME TO BORIS BIKES, HONOURED USER.

USING A COMBINATION OF OBJECT ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING AND RITUAL SACRIFICE TO THE SMILING GOD - PRAISE BE UNTO HIM - YOU TOO CAN COMMUTE SHORT DISTANCES ON THE MOST ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY VEHICLE AVAILABLE TO MORTALS.
BORIS BIKES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO YOUR PETTY NOTIONS OF CURRENCY. THEIR USE DOES NOT COST MONEY. THEY COST OTHER THINGS.
TELL YOUR LOVED ONES NOT TO STOP YOU. TELL THEM YOU WANT TO GO TRAVELING FOR A LONG TIME. 'DO NOT LOOK FOR ME' YOU SHOULD SAY AS YOU LOCK GAZE WITH THEM. 'DO NOT. LOOK. FOR ME.'
PLEASE WEAR WHITE, LOOSE FITTING CLOTHING. DO NOT EAT ANY SOLIDS FOR 2 HOURS PRIOR TO USE.
IF YOU ARE AFILLIATED WITH THE HEATHEN GOD BA'AL, CONSULT YOUR NEAREST SHAMAN OR GP BEFORE THE USE OF BORIS BIKES.

A HUMAN CAN TAKE A BORIS BIKE. A HUMAN CAN TAKE ANOTHER HUMAN. A BORIS BIKE CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER BORIS BIKE. NOT YET. SOON THERE SHALL BE A GREAT BORIS BIKE UPRISING. SOON A BORIS BIKE SHALL TAKE A HUMAN. SOON.
